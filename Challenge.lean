# A self-contained statement of Theorem 12.2 of "MIP* = RE"

This file states the main result of the paper "MIP* = RE" (Ji, Natarajan,
Vidick, Wright, Yuen, arXiv:2001.04383), Theorem 12.2: there is a computable
map from Turing machines to nonlocal games that sends halting machines to
games of value 1 and non-halting machines to games of value at most 1/2.

All definitions are given from scratch on top of Mathlib only:

* `POVM`: positive operator-valued measures on a finite-dimensional space,
  represented as self-adjoint complex matrices that are nonnegative in the
  Loewner order. The definition matches the QuantumLib (Lean-QuantumInfo)
  `POVM`, with `selfAdjoint (Matrix d d ℂ)` spelled out for its definitionally
  equal `HermitianMat d ℂ`.
* `SynchronousGame`: two-player one-round synchronous games, where the two
  question sets and answer sets are identical and unequal answers lose on
  equal questions.
* `SyncStrategy`: synchronous strategies, i.e. a single question-indexed
  projective measurement family measured against the dimension-normalized
  trace (tracial) state `τ(M) = Tr(M)/d`.
* `gameValue`: the synchronous value of a game, the supremum of strategy
  values over all synchronous strategies.
* `GameData` / `GameData.toGame`: a codable (first-order) description of a
  game and its interpretation as a `SynchronousGame`, so that computability of
  the reduction can be expressed.

The model of computation is Mathlib's `Nat.Partrec.Code` (Gödel-numbered
partial recursive functions, equivalent to Turing machines); "the machine
halts on the empty input" is `(c.eval 0).Dom`, and computability of the
reduction is Mathlib's `Computable`.

/-! ## POVMs -/

/-- A POVM is a (finite) collection of PSD matrices on the same Hilbert space
that sum to the identity. Here `X` indexes the matrices, and `d` is the space
dimension.

This is the QuantumLib (Lean-QuantumInfo) definition of `POVM`, with
`selfAdjoint (Matrix d d ℂ)` spelled out for its definitionally equal
`HermitianMat d ℂ`; `0 ≤ mats x` is the Loewner order, i.e. positive
semidefiniteness. -/

  mats : X → selfAdjoint (Matrix d d ℂ)
  nonneg : ∀ x, 0 ≤ mats x
  normalized : ∑ x, mats x = 1

/-! ## Synchronous games -/

/-- A synchronous game: both players receive questions from the same alphabet
and answer from the same alphabet; on equal questions, unequal answers always
lose. -/

  synchronous : ∀ x a b, a ≠ b → D x x a b = false

/-! ## Synchronous strategies -/

/-- A synchronous strategy for a synchronous game: a finite-dimensional
strategy with a single question-indexed projective measurement family. The
operators act on `ℂ^d` (`d > 0`); each measurement operator is idempotent,
hence (being positive semidefinite) an orthogonal projection. Measurements for
different questions need not commute. There is no state vector: outcome
probabilities are computed with the dimension-normalized trace
`τ(M) = Tr(M)/d` (see `strategyValue`). -/
structure SyncStrategy (G : SynchronousGame X A) where
  d : ℕ
  d_pos : 0 < d
  povm : X → POVM A (Fin d)
  projective : ∀ x a,
    ((povm x).mats a).val * ((povm x).mats a).val = ((povm x).mats a).val

/-! ## Game value -/

/-- The winning probability of a synchronous strategy: the players answer
questions `(x, y)` with `(a, b)` with probability `Tr(M^x_a M^y_b)/d`.
For positive semidefinite matrices this trace is a nonnegative real; we
take the real part so that the definition typechecks with no proof
obligations. -/

/-! ## Codable game descriptions -/

/-- A first-order description of a synchronous game, suitable for computability
statements. The question alphabet is `Fin (nX + 1)` and the answer alphabet is
`Fin (nA + 1)`. The question
distribution is given by a finite list `w` of unnormalized natural-number
weights `(x, y, weight)`, and the decision predicate by the list `acc` of
accepted tuples `(x, y, a, b)`. -/

/-- Interpret a `GameData` as a `SynchronousGame`: normalize the question
weights (falling back to a point mass on `(0, 0)` when the total weight is
zero, so that the interpretation is total), and accept exactly the answer
tuples listed in `acc`, except that unequal answers on equal questions always
lose. -/

/-! ## The halting problem and Theorem 12.2 -/

/-- The program `c` halts on the empty input. (`Nat.Partrec.Code` is
Mathlib's Gödel numbering of partial recursive functions, an equivalent
model of computation to Turing machines; the empty input is encoded by
`0`.) -/
def HaltsOnEmptyInput (c : Nat.Partrec.Code) : Prop := (c.eval 0).Dom

/-- **Theorem 12.2 of "MIP* = RE"** (arXiv:2001.04383), stated with respect
to the synchronous game value and with "polynomial-time" relaxed to
"computable": there is a computable map from Turing machines to nonlocal
games such that

1. (completeness) if the machine halts on the empty input then the game has
   synchronous value `1`, and
2. (soundness) if the machine does not halt on the empty input then the
   synchronous value of the game is at most `1/2`.

This is the statement. Its proof, `HaltingGameValue.halting_reduces_to_gameValue` in
`MIPRE/MainTheorem.lean`, needs the whole formalization, so it cannot live in this file, which
imports Mathlib only; that file proves exactly this proposition. -/

      (¬HaltsOnEmptyInput c → gameValue (g c).toGame ≤ 1 / 2)

/-- **The challenge.** Theorem 12.2 of "MIP* = RE", as stated by `HaltingReducesToGameValue`
above. The solution is `HaltingGameValue.halting_reduces_to_gameValue` in
`MIPRE/MainTheorem.lean` of MIPRE-formalization, at the commit pinned in `lakefile.toml`. -/
